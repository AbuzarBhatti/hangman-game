Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hangman-game.git
cd hangman-game
Install dependencies (if any):
If your game has external dependencies (e.g., pygame or others), include them here. For now, it's just a basic Python script, so no dependencies are required.

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt  # (If you have a requirements.txt)
Run the game:
To start the game, simply run the Python script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python hangman.py
Usage
Once you run the script, the game will prompt you to start guessing letters of a hidden word. You have a limited number of guesses (usually 6) before you lose the game.

The game shows underscores (_) for each letter in the word you are trying to guess.

After each guess, the game will update the display with the correctly guessed letters or an incomplete word.

The hangman will "draw" one part for each incorrect guess.
