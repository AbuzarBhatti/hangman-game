If your game has external dependencies (e.g., pygame or others), you can include them here. For now, it’s a basic Python script, so no dependencies are required. ✨

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt  # (If you have a requirements.txt)
Run the game:
To start the game, simply run the Python script:

bash

python hangman.py
🎮 How to Play
Once you run the script, the game will prompt you to guess the letters of a secret word. You have 6 incorrect guesses before the hangman is fully drawn!

The game displays underscores (_) for each letter in the word.

After each guess, it will update the word with the correct letters or show your missed attempts.

The hangman drawing will evolve as you make incorrect guesses.
